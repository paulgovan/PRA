#' PRA: Project Risk Analysis
#'
#' Project Risk Analysis (PRA) provides functions for quantitative risk analysis
#' of engineering and construction projects. The package includes methods for
#' Monte Carlo simulation, earned value management, Bayesian inference, sensitivity
#' analysis, and sigmoidal growth curve fitting.
#'
#' @srrstats {G1.2} *Life Cycle Statement: This package is in active development.
#'   The API is considered stable for major functions. Future development will
#'   focus on additional risk analysis methods and performance improvements.
#'   Users can expect backward compatibility for existing functions.*
#' @srrstats {G1.3} *All statistical terminology is defined in individual function
#'   documentation. Key terms include: Monte Carlo Simulation, Earned Value
#'   Management (EVM), Bayesian inference, sensitivity analysis, and sigmoidal
#'   growth models (Pearl, Gompertz, Logistic).*
