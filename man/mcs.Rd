\title{Monte Carlo Simulation.}
\usage{
mcs(num_sims, task_dists, cor_mat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_sims}{The number of simulations to run.}

\item{task_dists}{A list of lists describing each task distribution with its parameters.
Each task distribution should be specified as a list with a "type" field (indicating
the distribution type: "normal", "triangular", or "uniform") and the corresponding
parameters: for "normal" (mean, sd), for "triangular" (a, b, c), and for "uniform"
(min, max). For example:
list(
 list(type = "normal", mean = 10, sd = 2),
 list(type = "triangular", a = 5, b = 10, c = 15),
 list(type = "uniform", min = 8, max = 12)
 )}

\item{cor_mat}{The correlation matrix for the tasks (Optional). If not provided,
tasks are assumed to be independent.}
}
\value{
The function returns a list of the total mean, variance, standard deviation,
and percentiles for the project.
}
\description{
This function performs a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the total duration of a project
based on individual task distributions and an optional correlation matrix.
}
