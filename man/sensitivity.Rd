\title{Sensitivity Analysis.}
\usage{
sensitivity(task_dists, cor_mat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{task_dists}{A list of lists describing each task distribution. Each inner
list should contain the type of distribution and its parameters. Supported distributions
are "normal", "triangular", and "uniform".}

\item{cor_mat}{The correlation matrix for the tasks (Optional). If provided, it
should be a square matrix with dimensions equal to the number of tasks. If not
provided, tasks are assumed to be independent.}
}
\value{
The function returns a vector of sensitivity results with respect to
each task. Each element in the vector corresponds to the sensitivity of the variance
in total project cost with respect to the variance in the respective task's cost.
}
\description{
This function performs sensitivity analysis on a project with multiple tasks,
each having its own cost distribution. It calculates the sensitivity of the
variance in total project cost with respect to the variance in each task's cost.
It can also account for correlations between task costs if a correlation matrix
is provided.

# Set the correlation matrix between the tasks.
