\usage{
cost_post_pdf(
  num_sims,
  observed_risks,
  means_given_risks,
  sds_given_risks,
  base_cost = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_sims}{Number of random samples to draw from the posterior distribution.}

\item{observed_risks}{A vector of observed values for each risk event 'R_i' (1 if observed, 0 if not observed, NA if unobserved).}

\item{means_given_risks}{A vector of means of the normal distribution for cost 'A' given each risk event 'R_i'.}

\item{sds_given_risks}{A vector of standard deviations of the normal distribution for cost 'A' given each risk event 'R_i'.}

\item{base_cost}{The baseline cost given no risk event occurs.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of random samples from the posterior distribution of costs.
}
\description{
This function generates random samples from the posterior distribution of the cost 'A'
given observations of multiple risk events 'R_i'. Each risk event has its own mean
and standard deviation for the cost distribution. The function also accounts for a baseline cost
when no risk event occurs.
