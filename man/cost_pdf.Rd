\usage{
cost_pdf(
  num_sims,
  risk_probs,
  means_given_risks,
  sds_given_risks,
  base_cost = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{num_sims}{Number of random samples to draw from the mixture model.}

\item{risk_probs}{A vector of probabilities for each risk event 'R_i'.}

\item{means_given_risks}{A vector of means of the normal distribution for cost 'A' given each risk event 'R_i'.}

\item{sds_given_risks}{A vector of standard deviations of the normal distribution for cost 'A' given each risk event 'R_i'.}

\item{base_cost}{The baseline cost given no risk event occurs.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of random samples from the mixture model.
}
\description{
This function generates random samples from a mixture model representing the cost 'A'
associated with multiple risk events 'R_i'. Each risk event has its own probability,
mean, and standard deviation for the cost distribution. The function also accounts for a baseline cost
when no risk event occurs.
