\title{Estimate at Completion (EAC).}
\usage{
eac(bac, method = "typical", cpi = NULL, ac = NULL, ev = NULL, spi = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bac}{Budget at Completion (BAC) (total planned budget).}

\item{method}{The EAC calculation method. One of:
\itemize{
  \item "typical" (default): EAC = BAC / CPI. Assumes future work performed at current cost efficiency.
  \item "atypical": EAC = AC + (BAC - EV). Assumes future work performed at planned rate.
  \item "combined": EAC = AC + (BAC - EV) / (CPI * SPI). Considers both cost and schedule performance.
}}

\item{cpi}{Cost Performance Index (CPI). Required for "typical" and "combined" methods.}

\item{ac}{Actual Cost. Required for "atypical" and "combined" methods.}

\item{ev}{Earned Value. Required for "atypical" and "combined" methods.}

\item{spi}{Schedule Performance Index. Required for "combined" method.}
}
\value{
The function returns the Estimate at Completion (EAC).
}
\description{
Calculates the Estimate at Completion (EAC) using various methods based on
project performance assumptions.
}
\examples{
# Method 1: Typical - assumes current CPI continues
bac <- 100000
cpi <- 0.83
eac <- eac(bac, cpi = cpi)
cat("EAC (typical):", round(eac, 2), "\n")

# Method 2: Atypical - assumes future work at planned rate
ac <- 63000
ev <- 35000
eac <- eac(bac, method = "atypical", ac = ac, ev = ev)
cat("EAC (atypical):", round(eac, 2), "\n")

# Method 3: Combined - considers both CPI and SPI
spi <- 0.875
eac <- eac(bac, method = "combined", cpi = cpi, ac = ac, ev = ev, spi = spi)
cat("EAC (combined):", round(eac, 2), "\n")
