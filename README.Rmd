Data analysis for Project Risk Management in R:

* Second Moment Method
* Monte Carlo Simulation
* Contingency Analysis
* Sensitivity Analysis 
* Earned Value Management
* Learning Curves
* Design Structure Matrices
* And more!

## Installation

To install the release verion of PRA in R, use:
``` r
install_packages('PRA')
```

You can install the development version of PRA like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('paulgovan/PRA')
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem using Monte Carlo Simulation.

First, load the package:

``` {r}
library(PRA)
```

Next, set the number of simulations and describe probability distributions for 3 work packages:

```{r}
num_simulations <- 10000
task_distributions <- list(
  list(type = "normal", mean = 10, sd = 2),  # Task A: Normal distribution
  list(type = "triangular", a = 5, b = 10, c = 15),  # Task B: Triangular distribution
  list(type = "uniform", min = 8, max = 12)  # Task C: Uniform distribution
)
```

Then, set the correlation matrix between the 3 work packages:

```{r}
correlation_matrix <- matrix(c(
  1, 0.5, 0.3,
  0.5, 1, 0.4,
  0.3, 0.4, 1
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)
```

Finally, run the simulation using the `mcs` function:

```{r}
results <- mcs(num_simulations, task_distributions, correlation_matrix)
```

To calculate the mean of the total duration:

```{r}
cat("Mean Total Duration:", results$total_mean, "\n")
```

To calculate the variance of the total duration:

```{r}
cat("Variance of Total Duration:", results$total_variance, "\n")
```

To build a histogram of the total duration:

```{r}
hist(results$total_distribution, breaks = 50, main = "Distribution of Total Project Duration", 
     xlab = "Total Duration", col = "skyblue", border = "white")
```

## More Resources

Much of this package is based on the book [Data Analysis for Engineering and Project Risk Managment](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-14251-3) by Ivan Damnjanovic and Ken Reinschmidt and comes highly recommended.
