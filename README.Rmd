Data Analysis for Project Risk Managment via the Second Moment Method (SMM), Monte Carlo (MC) Simulation, Bayesian methods, Design Structure Matrices (DSMs), and more.

## Installation

To install the release verion of PRA, use:
``` r
install_packages('PRA')
```

You can install the development version of PRA like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github('paulgovan/PRA')
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem using Monte Carlo Simulation:

```{r example}
library(PRA)

num_simulations <- 10000
task_distributions <- list(
  list(type = "normal", mean = 10, sd = 2),  # Task A: Normal distribution
  list(type = "triangular", a = 5, b = 10, c = 15),  # Task B: Triangular distribution
  list(type = "uniform", min = 8, max = 12)  # Task C: Uniform distribution
)
correlation_matrix <- matrix(c(
  1, 0.5, 0.3,
  0.5, 1, 0.4,
  0.3, 0.4, 1
), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

results <- mcs(num_simulations, task_distributions, correlation_matrix)
cat("Mean Total Duration:", results$total_mean, "\n")
cat("Variance of Total Duration:", results$total_variance, "\n")
hist(results$total_distribution, breaks = 50, main = "Distribution of Total Project Duration", 
     xlab = "Total Duration", col = "skyblue", border = "white")
```

## More Resources

Much of this package is based on the book [Data Analysis for Engineering and Project Risk Managment](https://www.amazon.com/dp/3030142531?ref=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AC0JN7RWC29CM028V2YZ&ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AC0JN7RWC29CM028V2YZ&social_share=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_AC0JN7RWC29CM028V2YZ) by Ivan Damnjanovic and Ken Reinschmidt and comes highly recommended.
